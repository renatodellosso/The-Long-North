In Chapter 2, the PCs become aware of ways to end the night.

Chapter 2 has three main factions:
* Skyclaw's cult, which wants the night to continue
* Varen's forces, who want to slay Skyclaw to restore Varen's authority
* Shar-Anel's agents, who want to end the night and restore order, so Shar-Anel's influence can spread south
Tavaneir's cult has been disorganized after Davarak's death, but has sleeper agents planted in all 3 factions above.

There are 2 remaining requirements for ending the night:
* Kill Varen
* Destroy the crystal in the eastern mines
