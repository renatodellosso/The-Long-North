*N Female Human*

Greenfang, a druid of Nemein, has taken control of various bandit gangs and is using them to push out loggers and farmers.

She is willing to pay a significant amount for [[Skyclaw]]'s death. In case [[Skyclaw]] begins hunting her down, she plans to gain support in [[Hardstone]], so she can hunker down in caverns he cannot reach.

She is unaware of [[Fjaxes]] or [[Shar-Anel]], but, if alerted to their  existence, will view him as a higher priority than [[Skyclaw]]. She confident her forces could take on [[Fjaxes]], but dislikes the idea of moving the bandits across the tundra to fight [[Shar-Anel]].

Greenfang is constantly on the move with her camp throughout the woods, but avoids the open tundra and stays away from towns. Most of her forces are between the [[East River]] and the [[West River]].

Her forces are battling Tavaneir's cults in the central woods.

If alerted to possibility of ending the night, Greenfang would support it to weaken Tavaneir's forces.

She is quite rude and blunt.
