*CN North God*

Tavaneir has introduced vampirism to creatures in [[Jordel's Hold]]. They aim to spread it throughout the march, making the marchers able to survive in the night and then, with that advantage, overthrow the imperials.

Tavaneir plans to encourage [[Hetein]] or a replacement in [[Lake Varneir]] to liberate the whole march. He also plans to offer her people vampirism; at first he will ask her, but will go around her if she refuses.

Tavaneir has various cults of vampires and lycanthropes operating out of the central woods; his cults are currently fighting Greenfang's forces.

Tavaneir caused the night to empower his vampires and lycanthropes. He did so by creating three foci for the magic: his cult leader, a crystal in ancient western mines, and a traitor in Vajalharn.
