*CN North God*

Tavaneir has introduced vampirism to creatures in [[Jordel's Hold]]. They aim to spread it throughout the march, making the marchers able to survive in the night and then, with that advantage, overthrow the imperials.

Tavaneir plans to encourage [[Hetein]] to liberate the whole march. He also plans to offer her people vampirism; at first he will ask her, but go around her if she says no.
