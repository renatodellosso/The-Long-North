*LE Mind Flayer*

Fjaxes has been hiding in the caverns by [[Hardstone]]. He's the people of Hardstone into his thralls. To aid him, he's been creating cranium rats.

He would also like to implant a tadpole into [[Skyclaw]], which he believes will be aligned with his goals after ceremorphosis. He will offer the party 50 gp to do this.

If Fjaxes finds out about [[Tavaneir]]'s vampirism in [[Jordel's Hold]], he takes action against it, as vampires, being cold-blooded, cannot undergo ceremorphosis.

Fjaxes might attempt to "partner" with [[Hetein]]'s rebellion in [[Lake Varneir]], planning to seize control at a later date.
