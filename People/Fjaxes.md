*LE Mind Flayer*

Fjaxes has been hiding in the caverns by [[Hardstone]]. He's turned several townspeople into thralls, with plans to enthrall the rest. To aid him, he's been creating cranium rats.

He would also like to implant a tadpole into [[Denefel]], which he believes will be aligned with his goals after ceremorphosis.

If Fjaxes finds out about [[Tavaneir]]'s vampirism in [[Jordel's Hold]], he takes action against it, as vampires, being cold-blooded, cannot undergo ceremorphosis.
