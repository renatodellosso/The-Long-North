*LE Mind Flayer*

Fjaxes has been hiding in the caverns by [[Hardstone]]. He's enthralled the people of Hardstone. To aid him, he's been creating cranium rats.

Fjaxes has turned Skyclaw into a Brainstealer dragon, but is unsure if he can control the dragon.

If Fjaxes finds out about [[Tavaneir]]'s vampirism in [[Jordel's Hold]], he takes action against it, as vampires, being cold-blooded, cannot undergo ceremorphosis.

Fjaxes might attempt to "partner" with [[Hetein]]'s rebellion in [[Lake Varneir]], planning to seize control at a later date.

Fjaxes has sent a group of guards from Hardstone to find the PCs and request that they attempt to make alliances with locals groups for him.
