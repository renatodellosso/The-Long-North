*LN Male Kalashtar*

March Lord Varen is the ruler of the North March. He is native to the south and was appointed March Lord five years ago.

He is considering offering a bounty on [[Hetein]].

Varen would like reclaim [[Jordel's Hold]] (the castle, not the town) and use it as a beacon to aid in navigation.
