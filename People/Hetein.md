*LN Female Half-Orc*

Hetein is leader of the rebelling in [[Lake Varneir]]. She aims to fortify the land around [[Lake Varneir]] against the Imperials and then make peace.

Hetein is willing to pay for someone to assassinate [[March Lord Varen]].

Hetein has not decided whether to just try for [[Lake Varneir]]'s independence, or whether to recruit [[Eastpath]] and [[Jordel's Hold]] to the cause. She does not want a wider war with the imperials, but also wants the region's freedom. If offered, she would likely ally with [[Greenfang]] and her bandits.
