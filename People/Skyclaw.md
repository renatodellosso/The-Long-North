*NE Male Young Brainstealer Dragon*

Skyclaw has a lair at the top of Skyreacher Mountain. He plans to take over [[Eastpath]] and force the farmers there to pay livestock as tribute. Most of his hunting grounds are east of the [[East River]]; he avoids [[Vajalharn]] at all costs, believing that [[March Lord Varen]] would be able to have him killed if the lord was aware of him.

He is in control of a cult in Eastpath and plans to spread the cult to other towns. Skyclaw may ally with Fjaxes to triumph over non-Illithids, but would prefer not to.

He wants [[Hetein]] and [[March Lord Varen]] to go to war with each other, so he can then offer protection to one side.

He plans to encourage bandit gangs to revolt against [[Greenfang]] and then usurp control. He is willing to tolerate vampirism and lycanthropy. Once in control, he plans to have the bandits menace towns, to increase the value of his protection.
