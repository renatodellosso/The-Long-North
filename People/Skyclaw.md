*NE Male Young White Dragon*

Skyclaw has a lair at the top of Skyreacher Mountain. He plans to take over [[Eastpath]] and force the farmers there to pay livestock as tribute.

He wants [[Hetein]] and [[March Lord Varen]] to go to war with each other, so he can then offer protection to one side.

He plans to encourage bandit gangs to revolt against [[Greenfang]] and then usurp control. Once in control, he plans to have the bandit menace towns, to increase the value of his protection.
