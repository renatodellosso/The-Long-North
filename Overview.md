_A sandbox campaign about actions and their consequences_
What would you do if the sun didn’t come up tomorrow? In the dark, crops fail, armies scatter, and empires collapse. The resulting power vacuum fuels chaos, but also opportunity. Will you try to end the night? Seize power? Hunt down the monsters lurking in the shadows? It’s up to you, but just remember: there are no second chances in the Long North.

**What to Expect:** Combat: Infrequent, but dangerous Roleplaying: Frequent, high stakes Exploration: Frequent
