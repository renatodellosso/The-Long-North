# Buildings & Shops
## The Flayed Wyrm
The Flayed Wyrm Inn & Tavern is run by Adiren, a male hobgoblin. The building is mostly buried underground, with about half the upper floor visible. The top floor is the tavern, with a floor below for the inn, and a final floor for a brewery.

At any time, there are usually 6-10 patrons in the tavern and 3-4 guests staying at the inn.
## Aralosian Temple
Located in an old stone mansion, the local temple is staffed by three priests and a half-dozen acolytes. Since the dark, they have been busy reassuring townsfolk.

The temple has a small shrine to the sil'Ashatari on the third and uppermost floor.
