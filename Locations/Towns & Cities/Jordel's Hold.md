Jordel's Hold is a farming village named after [[Fort Jordel]], an abandoned castle just next to the village.

[[Tavaneir]] has contaminated a group of animals inside the hold with vampirism, which he wants to spread throughout the region to give the marchers an advantage over the empire.

[[March Lord Varen]] plans to reclaim the hold and use it to defend roadways to [[Port Henefel]]. [[Shar-Anel]] needs travel to and from Henefel so they can spread their influence south.

After the dark, Jordel's Hold collapsed into chaos. A few villagers have holed up in the keep, but were unable to make it more than a few rooms in.
