Hardstone is a mining village at the base of the western mountains. It provides stone and metals mined out of the nearby caverns to the rest of the march.

A mindflayer, [[Fjaxes]], is hiding deep in the caves and has a collection of tadpoles.

Hardstone has a ditch, a stone wall (under construction), a wooden wall. It is set with the center on a hill. Fjaxes' longhall is at the top and has its own stone wall.
