Shielded by the mountains, Lake Varneir is an isolated lake-side village.

The people of Lake Varneir, led by [[Hetein]], have risen in revolt against the provincial government.

The town has planted spikes in the ground around its land border and is working on a moat. However, the lakeshore is mostly unprotected.

After the sun didn't rise, Hetein rallied a militia to defend the town and barred anyone from entering or leaving.
