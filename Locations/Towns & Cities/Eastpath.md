Eastpath lies at the base of Skyreacher Mountain. It is surrounded by several miles of farmland and has paths up the mountain.

The dragon [[Skyclaw]] has made a nest at the top of the mountain. Locals often see it flying out to hunt. While it so far has been able to find enough prey, locals fear it might start eating livestock or villagers.
