Eastpath lies the mountainside at the base of Skyreacher Mountain. It is surrounded by several miles of farmland and has paths up the mountain. It is led by Bayak.

The dragon [[Skyclaw]] has made a nest at the top of the mountain. Locals often see it flying out to hunt.

The village has been taken over by a long-dormant dragon-worshipping cult. The cult is looking for meat to haul up the mountain to sacrifice to Skyclaw. The cult wants to sacrifice any agents of the North Gods to Skyclaw, but is willing to make a temporary alliance with the Aralosian Temple.
