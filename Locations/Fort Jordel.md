Fort Jordel lies at the top of a hill overlooking the town. It has been taken over by wild animals infected with vampirism by [[Tavaneir]]. **The stairs up lead to the roof.** The people of the town have taken refuge here.

There's a **mimic** lurking around the premises.
# Rooms
**1. Entryway**
The gate itself is long-gone, but the doorway is still intact and has been boarded over from the inside. 8 statues of knight line the pathway to the gate.

**2. Stables**
This building has been filled with grain

**3. Storeroom**
This room has been converted into living space, with several bedrolls on the floor

**7. Courtyard**
A pack of two **dire wolves** and one **werewolf** are fighting over the carcass of an unidentifiable animal. Anyone who is bitten by the werewolf must succeed on a DC 13 constitution save or be infected (do not inform players they've been infected). There is also a well and a hole in the ground from a meteorite.

**8. Watchtower**
A ladder leads up to the roof from here, but is unstable.

**9. Officer Barracks**
The door and the chest in one of these rooms are **mimics** with a small marking of ***an eye inside a circle*** inscribed on them. The chest was killed and the door escaped.

**12. Smithy**
A decrepit forge has been set up in this room.

**14. Temple**
A low-quality shrine to Aralos has replaced the previous, defaced one.

**16. Kitchen**
A scrawny dog is rooting around in a few barrels of rotten food left in here.

**19. Barracks**
A 10-lb mithril meteorite landed here, but was taken by the PCs.
