Fort Jordel lies at the top of a hill overlooking the town. It has been taken over by wild animals infected with vampirism by [[Tavaneir]]. **The stairs up lead to the roof.**
# Rooms
**1. Entryway**
The gate itself is long-gone, but the doorway is still intact and has been boarded over from the inside. 8 statues of knight line the pathway to the gate.

**2. Stables**
A group of villagers from the town has taken refuge here. They've barricaded the doors with what they could find (which isn't much) and have been hiding out in here. There are 4 commoners in here.

**3. Storeroom**
This is mostly empty, except for a wolf corpse with two fang marks in its neck.

**7. Courtyard**
