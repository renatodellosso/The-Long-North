Fort Jordel lies at the top of a hill overlooking the town. It has been taken over by wild animals infected with vampirism by [[Tavaneir]]. **The stairs up lead to the roof.** The people of the town have taken refuge here.
# Rooms

This building has been filled with grain

**3. Storeroom**
This room has been converted into living space, with several bedrolls on the floor

A pack of two **dire wolves** and one **werewolf** are fighting over the carcass of an unidentifiable animal. Anyone who is bitten by the werewolf must succeed on a DC 13 constitution save or be infected (do not inform players they've been infected).

**9. Officer Barracks**
The chest and bed in one of these rooms are **mimics** with a small marking of ***an eye inside a circle*** inscribed on them.

**12. Smithy**
A decrepit forge has been set up in this room. For some reason, it is still hot and has spilt coals all over the room.

A deck of cards has been left on the table and is covered in dust. The cards are written in Orcish.
