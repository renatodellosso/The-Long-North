Fort Jordel lies at the top of a hill overlooking the town. It has been taken over by wild animals infected with vampirism by [[Tavaneir]]. **The stairs up lead to the roof.**
# Rooms
**1. Entryway**
The gate itself is long-gone, but the doorway is still intact and has been boarded over from the inside. 8 statues of knight line the pathway to the gate.

**2. Stables**
A group of villagers (4 commoners) from the town has taken refuge here. They've barricaded the doors with what they could find (which isn't much) and have been hiding out in here.

**3. Storeroom**
This is mostly empty, except for a wolf corpse with two fang marks in its neck.

**7. Courtyard**
A pack of four wolves are fighting over the carcass of an unidentifiable animal. The wolves are infected with vampirism and anyone who is bitten must succeed on a DC 13 constitution save or be infected (do not inform players they've been infected). There is also a well and a hole in the ground from a meteorite.

**9. Officer Barracks**
The chest in one of these rooms is a mimic with a small marking of ***an eye inside a circle***.

**14. Temple**
The altar to Aralos has been defaced. In front of it, a small shrine to Tavaneir has been set up; ***a small token with a fang on it*** has been left on the shrine.

**16. Kitchen**
A scrawny dog is rooting around in a few barrels of rotten food left in here.

**18. Meeting Room**
A pile of bones lying in a puddle is in this room. When the PCs exit the room, the bones turn in a skeleton and the puddle turns into a gray ooze. If the PCs touch the puddle, they take 1 acid damage. The damage for the ooze's Pseudopod attack is only 1d4 + 1 bludgeoning and 1d6 acid.

**19. Barracks**
A mithril meteorite has landed here.
