- Edith says quite a lot, Varen follows Taveneir and kills those that do not.
    

- Do people like Varen‚Äôs rule?

# Going through the coffin portal

Rhobb came out of a coffin on a similar tower in the middle of a ruined city that resembles Vajalharn. The sun is out. Wilted trees. Sandy and hot. No signs of life.

  

We head out of town to look for Taveneir cult stuff in the center of the woods.¬†

  

Near the north gate of town outside the gate is a cloaked figure. They appear to be an angel made of fire (emissary of Aralos). Herbert is having a pretty good day with this. The angel thing thanks us. Angel confirms Taveneir is up to stuff. We are in the divine plane with all the gods. Taveneir stole our sun and has a fortress off the coast of Port Henefel. We have to go stop him and return the sun to our plane. Using the long dead scholars they can siphon Taveneirs energy into oblivion (space between the planes) to trap him forever. So we have to find a way to banish Taveneir to the in-between plane. There are supplies for us north of the west river. The angel gifts us a bottle of aloe vera lotion.¬†

  

Trees north of the road are very wilted. We found a fallen tree ent and try to give it water. The tree ent stands back up. We ride the tree towards the supplies. Occasionally we glimpse small creatures. In a dried-up riverbed, we found a shiny rock. The tree ent is called the big one.¬†

  

We climb up a mountain toward the supplies. Hot spring at the top with benches. In the middle of the hot spring is a large leather sack. There are four Aarakocra who are trying to get the bag out of the water.¬†

  

We get the bag.

  

My traveling companions are increasingly delirious from the heat.

  

We reach Port Henefel, and the sea level is very low. We see a weird lump and poke it. It‚Äôs a large dead fish.

  

We build a makeshift raft and paddle a mile off shore before our legs start to hurt. We find a whale to take us towards the fortress.**
