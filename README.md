This was a Dungeons & Dragons 5e (2014) campaign run by me and played by Owen (playing Rhobb the Paladin/Warlock), Aidan (playing Denk Trakom the Ranger/Cleric), Lyndon (playing Bao the Monk/Druid Werebear), and Isaac (playing Just Herbert the Grave Cleric). It ran from 12/15/2023 to 5/23/25, spanning 525 out-of-game days, 22 sessions, and 130 in-game days.

The campaign began when Tavaneir, the god of blood, stole the sun, plunging the North March into eternal night.

Along the way, the players allied with a Mindflayer, implanted a Mindflayer tadpole in a dragon, slew the dragon, killed the Mindflayer, joined up with a druid, staged a coup, ventured into the Divine Realm, and crawled through a god's sewer.

In the end, the players won, slaying Tavaneir, bringing back the sun, and restoring order to the North March.

This was the second campaign I ran to completion and the first homebrew campaign I completed.
