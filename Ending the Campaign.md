The night is caused by Tavaneir's magic, which is concentrated in three foci:
* Davarek, his cult leader (DEAD)
* March Lord Varen
* A crystal in the ancient eastern mines
If all three are killed/destroyed, the night will end.

Most cultists have heard of Davarek and know he's somewhere in the middle of the woods, at a shrine to Tavaneir.

If interrogated, Davarek has had visions of a mineshaft in the west. People in Eastpath or Fort Jordel have seen a mine entrance. He has also been instructed to prevent attacks on Vajalharn.
